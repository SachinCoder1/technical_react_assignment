The app includes authentication, data enrichment, deep linking, pagination, searching, sorting, and more!

## Features ‚ú®

### ‚úîÔ∏è **Authentication**
- Secure login/logout functionality with Zustand state management.
- User-friendly navigation with dynamic login/logout button in the navbar.
- Access restricted content based on authentication state.

### ‚úîÔ∏è **Resource Detail Page**
- Detailed view for each resource (character) with enriched data.
- Subsequent API calls using React Query to fetch related data like films and homeworld.
- Efficient error handling and loading states for a smooth user experience.

### ‚úîÔ∏è **Data Enrichment**
- Fetch additional information such as related films and homeworld details using `Promise.all` and `axios` inside `useQuery`.
- Display enriched data in an aesthetically pleasing manner using Mantine components like `List`, `Badge`, and `Card`.

### ‚úîÔ∏è **Deep Linking**
- Expandable URLs using query parameters (`search`, `sort`, `page`) to allow sharing links to specific search results or pagination states.
- Dynamic updates to URL query parameters without refreshing the page, ensuring smooth navigation and deep linking.

### ‚úîÔ∏è **Pagination**
